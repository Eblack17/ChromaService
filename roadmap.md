# AI-Powered Customer Service System: Development Roadmap (with Docker)

**This roadmap is designed to guide the AI assistant (Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Cursor) in building the project, including containerization with Docker.**

**Overall Goal:** Develop a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for customer service, utilizing LangChain for agent orchestration and a large language model for natural language understanding, all containerized with Docker for consistent deployment.

**AI Assistant:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (using Cursor)

**Phase 1: Project Setup and Docker Environment (Estimated Time: 1-2 days)**

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Create Project Directory:**
        *   Use Cursor to create a new project directory named `ai-customer-service`.
        *   Initialize a `README.md` file with a brief project description, including the use of Docker.
    2.  **Set up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
        *   Create a Python virtual environment within the project directory.
        *   Activate the virtual environment.
    3.  **Install Dependencies:**
        *   Use Cursor to install the following Python packages (list may need to be adjusted as the project evolves):
            *   `langchain`
            *   `openai` (if needed for any underlying LangChain defaults)
            *   `python-dotenv`
            *   `docker`
        *   You'll install database drivers and other dependencies later, as needed.
    4.  **API Key Configuration:**
        *   Create a `.env` file in the project root.
        *   Add necessary API keys.
        *   Write code to load API keys from the `.env` file using `python-dotenv`.
    5.  **Version Control (Git):**
        *   Initialize a Git repository.
        *   Create a `.gitignore` file, including standard entries and `venv/` (if using a virtual environment).
        *   Commit the initial project setup.
    6.  **Create Dockerfile:**
        *   Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root.
        *   Specify the base image (e.g., `python:3.9-slim`).
        *   Set the working directory inside the container.
        *   Copy the project files into the container.
        *   Install dependencies using `pip` (from a `requirements.txt` file - you'll create this later).
        *   Expose necessary ports (if needed).
        *   Define the command to run the application (you'll refine this as you develop).
    7.  **Create docker-compose.yml (for Multi-Container Setup):**
        *   Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root.
        *   Define the services:
            *   **app:** (or a similar name) for the main application, using the `Dockerfile`.
            *   **db:** (or a similar name) for the database (e.g., PostgreSQL), using an official database image.
        *   Specify environment variables, ports, and volumes (for data persistence).
        8.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose (Initial Test):**
            *   Use Cursor's integrated terminal or a separate terminal to run:
            ```bash
            docker-compose build
            docker-compose up -d
            ```
            *   Verify that the containers start without errors.
            *   You might need to make initial adjustments to `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` based on testing.

*   **Considerations:**
    *   Choose an appropriate base image in the `Dockerfile` that balances size and functionality.
    *   Decide on a database to use (PostgreSQL is a good choice).
    *   Document the Docker setup instructions clearly in the `README.md`.

**Phase 2: Core Agent Development (Estimated Time: 5-7 days)**

*   **Tasks:** (Each agent should be in its own `.py` file within a suitable directory structure)
    1.  **Greeter Agent (Chatbot):**
        *   Implement conversation initiation, basic information gathering, FAQ answering (simple for now), and routing logic.
        *   Use LangChain and prompt engineering to guide the agent's behavior.
        *   Test within the Docker container using `docker-compose exec app python your_agent_file.py` (replace `app` and `your_agent_file.py` with the correct service name and file).
    2.  **Email Management Agent:**
        *   Develop email categorization, prioritization, response generation, and routing logic.
        *   Use LangChain and appropriate prompts.
        *   Test with sample text inputs within the Docker container.
    3.  **Order Management Agent:**
        *   Implement order information retrieval, status updates, return/refund handling (basic logic), and modification handling.
        *   Use mock data initially.
        *   Test within the Docker container.
    4.  **Product/Service Information Agent:**
        *   Develop product information provision, Q&A capabilities, and basic recommendations.
        *   Use mock data initially.
        *   Test within the Docker container.
    5.  **Sentiment Analysis Agent:**
        *   Implement basic sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral).
        *   Test with sample text within the Docker container.
    6.  **Escalation Agent:**
        *   Develop logic to identify escalation triggers.
        *   Create placeholder functions for human agent handoff.

        * Develop logic to solicit customer feedback.
        * Implement placeholder functions for feedback analysis and report generation.
        * Test with mock conversation scenarios within the Docker container.
    8.  **Agent Orchestration (Main Script):**
        *   Create `main.py` or `app.py`.
        *   Use LangChain to define the overall flow.
        *   Import and initialize agents.
        *   Create a loop that takes input (text for now), routes it to the Greeter Agent, and orchestrates the conversation.
        *   Run and test the entire system within the Docker container: `docker-compose exec app python main.py`

*   **Considerations:**
    *   Focus on core agent logic first.
    *   Use placeholder functions and mock data for external integrations.
    *   Commit changes to Git regularly.
    *   **Test each agent thoroughly within the Docker container to ensure the environment is consistent.**

**Phase 3: Integrations and Enhancements (Estimated Time: 7-10 days)**

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Database Integration:**
        *   Set up the database container (defined in `docker-compose.yml`).
        *   Create database tables.
        *   Install the necessary database driver (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL) in the application container (add it to `requirements.txt` and rebuild).
        *   Integrate the Order Management and Product/Service Information agents with the database.
        *   Replace mock data with actual database interactions.
        *   Test thoroughly within the Docker environment.
    2.  **FAQ Enhancement (Vector Database):**
        *   Choose a vector database (consider a cloud-hosted option for easier integration).
        *   Create FAQ embeddings.
        *   Store embeddings in the vector database.
        *   Modify the Greeter Agent to use similarity search for FAQ retrieval.

    *   Continuously monitor performance and gather feedback.
    *   Analyze data to identify areas for improvement.
    *   Refine agent prompts and logic.
    *   Implement new features and enhancements.
    *   Stay up-to-date with technology advancements.

*   **Considerations:**
    *   Establish a process for collecting and prioritizing feedback.
    *   Plan for regular maintenance and updates.
    *   Continuously evaluate the system's performance and ROI.

**Important Notes for using Docker with Cursor:**

*   **Cursor's Terminal:** Use Cursor's integrated terminal to run Docker commands.
*   **`requirements.txt`:** As you install dependencies, create and update a `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory. Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to generate it. This file will be used in your `Dockerfile` to install dependencies inside the container.
*   **Rebuilding Images:** When you modify your code or dependencies, rebuild your Docker images using `docker-compose build`.
*   **Docker Compose for Development:** Use `docker-compose up -d` to start your application in detached mode during development.
*   **Testing in Docker:** Run tests inside the container using `docker-compose exec app pytest` (or the appropriate command for your testing framework).

This roadmap provides a detailed plan for building the AI-Powered Customer Service System. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, using Cursor, should be able to follow these steps, leveraging its coding abilities and the structure provided by the roadmap to build, test, and deploy the application effectively. Remember that communication and feedback between the AI and the human developer are essential throughout the process.
